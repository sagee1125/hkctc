/**
 * This is a simple routing configuration for your React project.
 * Each route is defined with a `path`, `element` (the React component to render),
 * and an optional `title`. This allows easy maintenance and addition of new pages.
 *
 * ### How to Add a New Route for a New Page:
 *
 * 1. **Create a New Page Component**:
 *    - First, create a new React component for the page you want to add.
 *    - Save it in the `pages` folder.
 *    - For example, if you want to add a page for "New Page", create a new file `NewPageName.tsx` and define your React component inside it.
 *    ```tsx
 *    // pages/NewPageName.tsx
 *
 *    import React from "react";
 *    const NewPageName = () => {
 *      return <div>Your HTML</div>;
 *    };
 *    export default NewPageName;
 *    ```
 *
 * 2. **Update the Routes Configuration**:
 *    - In the `routesConfiguration` array, add a new object for your page.
 *    - Set the `path` to the URL path where you want this page to be accessed.
 *    - Set the `element` to the component you just created.
 *    - Optionally, add a `title` for better clarity.
 *    ```tsx
 *    import NewPageName from "../pages/NewPageName";
 *
 *    export const routesConfiguration: RouteConfig[] = [
 *      ... // Existing routes
 *      {
 *        path: "/new-page-name", // The URL path for the new page
 *        element: <NewPageName />, // The component to render when this route is matched
 *        title: "About New Page", // Optional title for clarity
 *      },
 *    ];
 *    ```
 *
 * 3. **Navigate to the New Page**:
 *    - Now that the route is added, you can navigate to it using a `<Link>` component or programmatically with `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom`.
 *    - Example:
 *    ```tsx
 *    import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
 *    // Add a link to navigate to the new page
 *    <Link to="/new-page-name">About New Page</Link>
 *    ```
 *
 * ### Configuration Flexibility:
 * - The route configuration is flexible and can be easily modified. You can add, remove, or modify routes without touching the core application logic.
 * - This setup is ideal for clients who want a simple and maintainable solution for managing multiple pages.
 *
 * ### Notes for Maintenance:
 * - Always ensure that the component path (`element`) points to the correct page file.
