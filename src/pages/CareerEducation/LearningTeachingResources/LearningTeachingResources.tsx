          STEM Teaching Kit on Testing and Certification for Junior Secondary
          Students
        </p>

        <p className="text-body-m">
          The Innovation and Technology Commission and HKCTC have commissioned
          Hong Kong Baptist University to develop a STEM teaching kit for junior
          secondary students. The kit consists of six experiments, introducing
          some basic scientific knowledge and concepts about product testing and
          analysis. Through providing students with more practical
          opportunities, the kit aims to arouse studentsâ€™ interest in STEM
          subjects while raising their awareness of the importance of testing to
          ensure the safety and quality of products commonly used in daily life.
          Schools are welcome to make use of the kit in class or
          extra-curricular activities.
