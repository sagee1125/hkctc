        Since the signing of the Supplement VII to CEPA, the Mainland has been
        gradually opening up its CCC market to Hong Kong testing and
        certification bodies. Testing organisations in Hong Kong are now allowed
        to co-operate with designated Mainland certification bodies to undertake
        testing of all products that require CCC which are processed or
        manufactured in any place (including places outside China).
        <br />
        <br />
        Any testing organisations engaging in testing business for products
        under the CCC System have to be accredited by Hong Kong Accreditation
        Service (HKAS) to be capable of performing testing for the relevant
        products. Procedures for testing organisations in applying for relevant
        accreditation from HKAS could be viewed at&nbsp;
