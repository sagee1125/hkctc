        The Council, Government Laboratory, Hong Kong Metropolitan University
        and the Standards and Calibration Laboratory (SCL) of Innovation and
        Technology Commission have co-organised the Metrology Symposium 2022.
        <br />
        <br />
        Metrology is the science of measurement, embracing both experimental and
        theoretical determinations at any level of uncertainty in any field of
        science and technology. In our daily life, we will inevitably encounter
        applications related to metrology. For example, when running, we use a
        stopwatch to record timing; when sending mail, we use a pound and a
        ruler to measure the weight and size of the package respectively.
        Metrology also applies to chemical measurements, such as food inspection
        and environmental analysis, to protect our lives. Precise measurement
        can provide a solid foundation for the development of science and
        technology, thereby improving people's quality of life. In this seminar,
        we have shared some applications of metrology that are closely related
        to our everyday life, and have introduced the scientific principles
        behind them. The seminar has also introduced the latest developments in
        this year's World Metrology Day theme, " Metrology in the Digital Era".

    content: (
      <p>
        As our world gets increasingly digitalised and interconnected,
        information and cyber security continues to be a big concern.
        Organisations with inadequate security measures are often prone to
        unauthorised attacks and intrusion, thereby undermining the confidence
        of their clients and the public at large.
        <br />
        <br />
        Having a security management system is an effective way to control
        business risks. It helps to operate and monitor cyber and information
        security in a systematic manner. This webinar aims to introduce the
        latest trends of information and cyber security, and share the
        experience and insights in using information security management system
        certification in businesses and operations.

        The Council, Government Laboratory, the Open University of Hong Kong and
        the Standards and Calibration Laboratory (SCL) of Innovation and
        Technology Commission co-organised the Metrology Symposium 2021.
        <br />
        <br />
        Metrology is the science of measurement. It covers all theoretical and
        practical aspects of measurements, whatever the fields and applications.
        In the modern society, every aspect of our life will inevitably involve
        metrology. For example, our mobile phones are full of sensors to measure
        acceleration, rotational speed, light, sound and even altitude and
        magnetic field. Your smart watch can measure your heart rate and blood
        oxygen level besides telling you the time. You purchase food from the
        supermarket and numerous tests have been conducted on them by analysts
        behind the scene. Also, in time of pandemics, metrology has come to our
        defense. In this symposium, we have selected several interesting topics
        around our daily life to share how metrology plays its role. Taking this
        opportunity, the recent development in the transformation of the
        International System of Units (SI) to the digital world led by the
        International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) were also
        reported in this symposium.

      "“Underground Utility Survey Based on Nondestructive Testing, Surveying, Imaging and Diagnostic (NDTSID) Approaches” Webinar",
    date: "5 January 2021",
    content: (
      <p>
        The underground environment of Hong Kong consists of extensive arrays of
        utilities networks. All these networks serve our daily life through the
        provision of sewers, mains water, gas, telecommunications and
        electricity, etc. It is crucial to conduct regular and high-quality
        underground utility (UU) survey to ensure proper function of these
        utilities, thereby upholding efficient operation of the city.
        <br />
        <br />
        The webinar aims to introduce the latest development in conducting UU
        surveys using NDTSID approaches. Representatives from the Singapore Land
        Authority and Water Supplies Department of the Hong Kong SAR Government
        shared their experience and insights in different UU technologies and
        applications. Representatives from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University
        and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service also introduced the new
        specification standards for imaging and diagnosis of underground
        utilities using NDTSID approaches, and the new accreditation service for
        UU survey.

      <p>
        The Council, Government Laboratory, the Open University of Hong Kong and
        the Standards and Calibration Laboratory (SCL) of Innovation and
        Technology Commission co-organised the Metrology Symposium 2020.
        <br />
        <br />
        The International System of Units made a major revision of the SI, the
        foundation of measurements on May 20, 2019. The seven base units,
        namely, second, metre, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela were
        redefined based on the fundamental constants related to the fundamental
        laws of nature. The re-definition removes the instability imposed by the
        use of artefact standards and makes these SI base units “fundamentally
        better”.
        <br />
        <br />
        The revision of the SI enables the base units to be realized with
        accuracies limited only by the physical nature and our technical
        capability but not by their definitions. In recent year many innovative
        primary methods have been developed or refined for the practical
        realization of the base units using the law of physics. There were also
        numerous advances in the field of reference material and the metrology
        of chemistry and biology. The Symposium attempted to unfold to the local
        testing and certification industry as well as the parties interested in
        metrology how the revised SI will enable us to enhance the accuracy in
        measurement science and technology. Advance topics in the latest
        research and development related to the primary standards in various
        fields were also discussed.

      <p>
        The Council and Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised Seminar on
        Product Certification on Construction Materials.
        <br />
        <br />
        Building safety is of paramount importance, and quality of construction
        materials forms a vital part of it. Construction materials product
        certification helps assure quality of construction materials through
        third-party assessment. It enables upstream quality control from the
        start of the supply chain, facilitates better product traceability, and
        enhances production consistency. Through regular surveillance of the
        production process of construction materials, product certification
        reduces the risk of failure in on-site compliance testing. Users will
        also have greater confidence on product quality in view of its
        compliance with recognised standards or specific requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar aims to introduce how product certification could help
        improve construction and building quality. Representatives from the Hong
        Kong Concrete Institute, the Hong Kong Housing Authority and the Hong
        Kong Accreditation Service shared with us their experience and insights
        on the merits of adopting certified construction materials and products.
        An expert from BEAM Society also introduced the materials requirements

        <br />
        <br />
        The International Network on Quality Infrastructure and the World Bank
        recently agreed on a new definition of the Quality Infrastructure (QI):
        ‘The system comprising the organisations (public and private) together
        with the policies, relevant legal and regulatory framework, and
        practices needed to support and enhance the quality, safety and
        environmental soundness of goods, services and processes.’ This system
        relies on metrology, standardisation, accreditation, conformity
        assessment and market surveillance. The QI is a crucial platform for
        promoting sustainable economic growth, as well as for maintaining
        environmental and social wellbeing. It does not only support domestic
        markets, but its international recognition is also essential for
        accessing foreign markets.
        <br />
        <br />
        This forum, organised in celebration of the World Metrology Day (WMD),
        World Accreditation Day (WAD) and World Standards Day (WSD), introduced
        the pivotal roles of metrology, accreditation and standards in
        supporting the QI.

        The Council, Hong Kong Accreditation Service and Hong Kong Business
        Ethics Development Centre co-organised Seminar on Professional Ethics
        and Integrity in Testing and Certification.
        <br />
        <br />
        Integrity and credibility are foundation of good business. They also
        form part of the core value of Hong Kong’s testing and certification
        (T&C) industry and are an important aspect of our competitive edge. To
        sustain the industry’s good reputation, it is imperative for the T&C
        organisations to maintain a high standard of integrity and adopt good
        practices in their business and operations.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar invited representatives from the ICAC and the Customs and
        Excise Department to offer useful advice on anti-corruption regulations
        and fair trading practice, and analyse the common risks and ethical
        issues that may be encountered by T&C practitioners. A T&C organisation
        also shared its view on the importance of practising anti-bribery
        measures in the T&C trade.

      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on New Opportunities for Testing and Certification in the Age of
        Technology.
        <br />
        <br />
        The rapid development of technology, together with Hong Kong's
        transformation into a smart city, is creating new opportunities for the
        testing and certification (T&C) industry. On the one hand, T&C bodies
        could adopt new technologies such as robotics, automation, artificial
        intelligence, data analytics, blockchain, etc. to enhance operation
        efficiency and improve customer service. On the other, the emergence of
        smart products and Internet of Things would generate new demands for
        third party quality and safety assurance.
        <br />
        <br />
        This seminar covered various topics including the latest developments of
        Hong Kong as a Smart City, new technologies which could be adopted by
        the T&C industry, and updates on measurement standards. The seminar also
        shared the potential needs for T&C services to cater for new types of
        smart products, and introduced some funding schemes that could support
        the adoption of technology. This seminar was an opportunity for testing
        and certification industry to obtain relevant information for grasping
        the new opportunities ahead.

      <p>
        The Council, Hong Kong Accreditation Service and the Food Safety and
        Technology Research Centre of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University
        co-organised the Seminar on Testing and Certification for Food Safety.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nowadays, consumers are very vigilant about food safety and quality. To
        protect public health, the Government, food suppliers and catering
        establishments all play an important role in ensuring food sold in Hong
        Kong is safe and fit for consumption. The testing and certification
        (T&C) industry also serves as a gatekeeper, helping the food trade in
        ensuring their hygiene standards and meeting local regulations. It also
        helps the catering industry in enhancing consumers' confidence over food
        safety and hygiene through food certification..
        <br />
        <br />
        Local research institutes have also paid much efforts in safeguarding
        food safety through developing food technology. Through collaboration
        amongst the food trade, T&C industry and research institutes, the ever
        increasing public demand for safer, higher quality food products could
        be better met by applying these cutting-edge technologies.
        <br />
        <br />
        This seminar introduced to the audience latest development in food
        safety technology and regulation.

      <p>
        The Council, Government Laboratory, the Open University of Hong Kong and
        the Standards and Calibration Laboratory (SCL) of Innovation and
        Technology Commission co-organised the Metrology Symposium 2019.
        <br />
        <br />
        The International System of Units made a major revision of the SI, the
        foundation of measurements on May 20, 2019. Four of the seven SI base
        units namely kilogram, ampere, kelvin and mole were redefined based on
        the fundamental constants, which removed the current limitations imposed
        by the use of artefact standards. The change would bring significant
        impacts and further developments to the modern world.
        <br />
        <br />
        The poster designed by SCL was selected as the poster of the World
        Metrology Day 2019. The design ideas were based on modern world is
        becoming smarter with many smart technologies such as artificial
        intelligence (AI), big data, robotics, virtual reality (VR), 5G and
        autonomous vehicles etc., in which they are all built on smart sensors
        and transducers and rely on precision measurements. With better
        foundation of metrology, a better and smarter world can be built. This
        Symposium attempted to unfold to the local testing and certification
        industry as well as the parties interested in metrology how the revision
        of SI would enable us to embrace further improvements in measurement
        science and technology for a better and smarter world.

        The Council and Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the Seminar
        on Latest Development of Certification.
        <br />
        <br />
        In today's competitive global economy, companies and organisations have
        to explore different ways to stand out in the crowd. Certification is an
        effective tool to show one's competence. It helps companies and
        organisations demonstrate their commitment to delivering consistent
        quality service and products that meet customers' expectations, and
        assure compliance of their systems and products with international
        standards. It enhances and reinforces customers' confidence as well as
        adds credibility. In light of the benefits brought about by
        certification, some government departments and organisations even make
        certification a contractual requirement for tenders.
        <br />
        <br />
        This seminar aimed to introduce the latest development of certification
        including the newly developed ISO 45001 Occupational and Safety
        Management Systems Certification and updated versions of different
        management system certification released by International Organisation
        for Standardardization (ISO) such as ISO 50001:2018 Energy Management
        System Certification. Speakers shared their experience in making use of
        certification service to accomplish their objectives.

        <br />
        <br />
        One of Hong Kong's key strengths is the high level of integrity and
        credibility of the Hong Kong society as a whole, which gives confidence
        to users of testing and certification (T&C) services. Maintaining a high
        level of professional integrity is of utmost importance and ensures that
        T&C services are provided in a reliable, consistent and impartial
        manner.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this workshop, representative of ICAC gave an analysis on common
        corruption risks and ethical issues encountered by practitioners in the
        T&C industry.

        The Mainland has again introduced new liberalisation measures relating
        to testing and certification (T&C) under the CEPA framework in recent
        months. Two liberalisation measures related to certification were
        introduced under the CEPA Agreement on Economic and Technical
        Cooperation signed in June 2017. The Implementation Guide for the
        Articles Relating to Certification and Accreditation in the CEPA
        Agreement on Trade in Services promulgated in September 2017 included
        new liberalisation measures in the areas of China Compulsory
        Certification (CCC) and factory inspection.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar was held to enhance knowledge of the local T&C industry on
        the Mainland market. Representatives from the Certification and
        Accreditation Administration of the People's Republic of China (CNCA)
        and China Quality Certification Centre (CQC) updated participants on the
        liberalisation measures, and discussed the cooperation arrangements
        between Hong Kong T&C industry and Mainland certification bodies.
        Representative from the Hong Kong Accreditation Service (HKAS) also
        briefed the audience on the procedures and requirements for local
        testing organisations to obtain accreditation for CCC testing.

        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on "Testing and Certification for Environmental Excellence".
        <br />
        <br />
        With increasing awareness of the importance of environmental protection,
        many enterprises and organisations have put in place green management
        and energy conservation measures. In this regard, the testing and
        certification industry has been providing valuable support. Local
        testing and certification bodies are helping to monitor the conditions
        of our environment. For example, they conduct testing on air samples to
        assess air quality, take water samples to check the amount of heavy
        metals, etc. In addition, they provide third party certification
        services for environmental related management systems to help
        enterprises and organisations achieve their environmental objectives in
        accordance with international standards.
        <br />
        <br />
        This seminar aimed to introduce how testing and certification services
        can help improve the environment and enhance energy efficiency for
        buildings, facilities and offices. We invited representatives from the
        Hong Kong Accreditation Service, professional body and testing and
        certification organisations to share their insights on the needs for and
        benefits of different environmental-related testing and certification
        services. A commercial company also shared its experience in making use
        of certification service to accomplish its environmental conservation
        objectives.

        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on "Support to the Testing and Certification Industry".
        <br />
        <br />
        Testing and certification is an industry where Hong Kong enjoys clear
        advantages. To support the industry for further development, different
        Government departments, public bodies and education institutions have
        been implementing various schemes and measures to enhance the
        competitiveness of the industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar aimed to introduce these schemes and measures to
        practitioners and stakeholders of the testing and certification
        industry. Representatives from Government departments spoke on the
        various funding schemes that provided support to the industry,
        especially small and medium enterprises. The Hong Kong Export Credit
        Insurance Corporation talked about its Testing and Inspection Services
        Policy. Two post-secondary institutions shared their experience in
        training and attracting talents, and introduced how the academia and the
        trade could work together for manpower development of the industry.

        The Council and the Standards and Calibration Laboratory co-organised
        the Metrology Symposium 2017.
        <br />
        <br />
        In November 2018, the 26th General Conference on Weights and Measures
        (CGPM) reviewed the International System of Units (SI) of four of the
        seven base units namely kilogram, ampere, kelvin and mole by fixing the
        values of the Planck constant (h), the elementary charge (e), the
        Boltzmann constant (k) and the Avogadro constant (NA). Upon approval,
        the redefined SI would be implemented worldwide on the following World
        Metrology Day which is on 20 May 2019.
        <br />
        <br />
        Obviously, this event will have major impacts on the worldwide science
        and metrology community. This Symposium attempted to unfold the latest
        development of this important event to the local testing and
        certification industry, as well as the parties interested in metrology.
        Taking this opportunity, the progress in revision of a seminal document
        for the metrology community – "Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in
        Measurement" was also reported in the Symposium.

        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Testing and Certification of Wireless and Telecommunication
        Products.
        <br />
        <br />
        In recent years, wireless, telecommunication and smart products have
        been undergoing rapid development and have formed an important part of
        people's daily life. While these products may help leading us to a
        smarter way of living, their safety and performance are of paramount
        concern.
        <br />
        <br />
        Testing and certification plays a vital role in ensuring the safety and
        quality of products. Through third party testing and certification
        services, manufacturers and traders could be assured that these products
        comply with international standards or regulations, thus enhancing
        product quality and consumer confidence, and establishing good
        reputation.
        <br />
        <br />
        This seminar aimed to introduce the latest trend and development in
        testing and certification on wireless and telecommunication products.
        Different parties including government department, trade and
        professional bodies, and testing and certification organisations were
        invited to share their insight on the needs, benefits and latest
        requirements for testing and certification of these products.

    title: "Support to SME from Testing and Certification",
    date: "19 January 2017",
    content: (
      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Support to SME from Testing and Certification.
        <br />
        <br />
        Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are an important pillar of Hong
        Kong's economy. They form the majority of enterprises in Hong Kong and
        employ half of the private-industry workforce. It would be beneficial to
        the whole economy if SMEs are able to enhance their global
        competitiveness through using testing and certification (T&C) services.
        <br />
        <br />
        For decades, the local T&C industry has been supporting the
        manufacturing, export and other sectors in Hong Kong. It enjoys good
        international reputation and testing reports and certificates issued in
        Hong Kong are hallmark of excellence. The T&C industry provides quality
        assurance and helps our SMEs to comply with different international
        standards and regulations, thus minimising the chance of recalls,
        returns and complaints, which all would ultimately translate to new
        business opportunities. Apart from testing, the industry also provides a
        wide range of management system certification service to help the SMEs
        to enhance their management and service quality.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this seminar, different T&C bodies and Hong Kong Accreditation
        Service introduced T&C services and their benefits, and shared how to
        select a reliable T&C service. Various support being provided to the
        SMEs such as the Technology Voucher Programme, and the testing
        facilities for shared use were introduced. We also invited SMEs to share
        their experience in using T&C service, deepening participants'
        understanding about the topics.

        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Food Testing and Certification.
        <br />
        <br />

        products from all over the world can be found here. To maintain Hong
        Kong's reputation as the culinary capital of Asia, it is equally
        important to assure food safety as well as to maintain food variety and
        excellent culinary skill.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Government, the food and catering trade, and the testing and
        certification industry are the key players in ensuring food safety.
        Through regulatory control and other initiatives, the Government
        monitors food safety at critical points along the entire supply chain.
        The food and catering trade makes use of testing and certification
        services to enhance customers' confidence over safety and quality.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar aimed to provide participants with essential information on
        the food surveillance programme undertaken by the Centre for Food
        Safety, the professional support provided by the testing and
        certification industry as well as the experience of using testing and
        certification service shared by the trade.

      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Workshop on ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System
        Certification 2016.
        <br />
        <br />
        Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a management system or
        a part of the overall management system using a systematic approach for
        establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing,
        maintaining and improving information security. It is applicable to
        organisations of all sizes and in all business sectors, particularly
        those which need to store and/ or handle sensitive personal or
        commercial information.
        <br />
        <br />
        Given the increasing concern over information security and the potential
        loss to business due to security breaches, more organisations are aware
        of the advantages of being certified to ISO/IEC 27001, which is one of
        the most well-recognised ISMS standards globally. Certification of ISMS
        to ISO/IEC 27001 allows an organisation to demonstrate that its
        information assets are adequately protected against information security
        risks. It gives greater confidence to its business partners, clients,
        authorities and other interested parties.
        <br />
        <br />
        The workshop gave an overview of ISO/IEC 27001 and discussed how to get
        prepared for the certification process. There was also experience
        sharing by certified users, as well as an introduction on the services
        provided by the Hong Kong Accreditation Service.

      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Testing and Certification for Fire Safety in Buildings.
        <br />
        <br />
        The recent fire at an industrial building in Hong Kong has sparked
        public concern about building fire safety. Fire safety in buildings is
        determined by a number of factors including, for example, the fire
        resistance of the building materials. It is vital that building
        structure and components as well as the fire products and equipment
        installed could meet stringent safety and performance standards. Testing
        and certification plays a key role in ensuring the performance and
        quality of these components, installations and equipment meet the latest
        fire safety requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this seminar, Government departments, professional bodies and
        institutions were invited to provide updates on the latest development
        of testing methods, requirements, properties and product certification
        schemes of different fire protection building components and products.

    content: (
      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Accreditation for Medical Laboratories – The Road Towards
        Quality and Competence.
        <br />
        <br />
        Medical laboratories provide essential support to the medical industry.
        Accurate and reliable laboratory services are crucial for proper
        clinical diagnosis and treatment. Accreditation provides formal
        third-party recognition to competent medical laboratories. The
        accredited medical laboratories are rigorously assessed against
        international standards in carrying out laboratory testing, thus
        assuring the standard of operation and quality of report.
        <br />
        <br />
        Today, accreditation is highly regarded internationally as an indicator
        of quality assurance and technical competence. There is a growing trend
        in the world to require accreditation for medical laboratories. In some
        places, accreditation becomes conditional for payments and reimbursement
        of expenses for health care insurance. The conduct of clinical trial
        studies in most countries also only accepts data from accredited
        laboratories. To be in line with the standards of other advanced
        countries, it is important for medical laboratories in Hong Kong to
        obtain formal recognition of their testing competence and standard
        through laboratory accreditation. The seminar was organised to introduce
        the medical testing accreditation, share the experience of obtaining
        accreditation and the benefits of it, and encourage medical laboratories
        to further enhance their professionalism through laboratory
        accreditation.

      <p>
        The Council, the Hong Kong Accreditation Service and the Independent
        Commission Against Corruption co-organised the Seminar on Integrity
        Management in Testing and Certification Industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the key strengths of the testing and certification industry in
        Hong Kong is its high level of credibility, which gives confidence to
        users and consumers. A single incident of malpractice, conflict of
        interest or corruption could ruin a hard-earned business, or even
        reputation and competitiveness of the whole industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar brought together experts from ICAC, the testing and
        certification industry as well as professional bodies to share
        experiences and information about integrity management in the testing
        and certification industry from different perspectives and how good
        practices could add values to enhance the credibility of a service
        provider. Participants took this opportunity to exchange views on
        integrity management with speakers.

        Given Hong Kong's proximity to Mainland and its long history as a major
        trading hub in the region, Hong Kong has played an important role in
        Chinese medicines trading. Traditional Chinese medicine has been
        increasing its popularity amongst local population. Many citizens would
        consult Chinese medicine practitioners and use Chinese medicines.
        <br />
        <br />
        To ensure that the Chinese medicines sold in Hong Kong are genuine, safe
        and with good quality, testing and certification is an important means.
        The seminar aimed to update participants the latest development of Hong
        Kong Chinese Materia Medica Standards and testing and certification
        services for Chinese medicines, and to share benefit to the trade
        through testing and certification.

    title: "Product Certification on Construction Materials",
    date: "13 November 2015",
    content: (
      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Product Certification on Construction Materials.
        <br />
        <br />
        Testing and certification services for construction materials are
        important as they contribute to quality construction projects. Product
        certification involves a third party issuing assurance that a product
        conforms to specific requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        The benefits of product certification are many. Product quality can be
        promoted through upstream control, and consistency of quality can be
        ensured through continuous surveillance of the production process in the
        factory, and there will be better traceability of products.
        <br />
        <br />
        Through these quality control actions provided by a third party, the
        risk of failure in on-site compliance testing is reduced, thereby
        reduces the risk of delay and the waste of time and money in case
        reordering is required. End-product users will have greater confidence
        on product quality in view of its compliance with recognised standards
        or specific requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar aimed to introduce to the construction industry about
        product certification. Participants took this opportunity to know more
        about product certification of construction materials/products and how
        it helps to ensure quality from the very beginning when the products are
        still being manufactured.

      <p>
        The Council, the Hong Kong Accreditation Service, the Hong Kong
        Association for Testing, Inspection and Certification and the
        Independent Commission Against Corruption co-organised the Seminar on
        Professional Integrity in Testing and Certification.
        <br />
        <br />
        It has been said that, in its bare bone, testing and certification
        service is but trustworthiness. While the saying oversimplifies matters,
        it carries a certain degree of truth: professional integrity is the
        cornerstone of the testing and certification industry. Commitment to
        professional integrity protects the industry from corruption, conflicts
        of interests and the like, as well as advances the industry's
        competitive advantage internationally. It is important for the
        industry's development to continue to maintain its high level of
        professional integrity.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar brought together experts from ICAC, the testing and
        certification industry, professional bodies as well as government
        departments to talk in details from different perspectives about the
        management and practice of professional integrity in the testing and
        certification industry. The seminar shared experience and information on
        training/recognition. Participants took this opportunity to exchange
        views on integrity management with the speakers.

      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Sharing on R&D Projects of Medical Testing.
        <br />
        <br />
        With growing awareness of the benefits of regular health check-ups and
        an aging population, the demand for medical testing has been on a steady
        rise in the past several years, and the trend is expected to maintain.
        For the testing and certification industry, the demand can be a
        challenge and an opportunity. One of the ways to meet the demand is
        through research and development (R&D) to develop new medical testing
        methods and techniques or improve existing ones. R&D advancements in
        medical testing will not only provide strong support to the testing and
        certification industry, but also benefit the general public.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar aimed to showcase several R&D projects on medical testing
        funded by the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF). ITF is a government
        initiative to encourage and assist organisations to upgrade their
        technological level. Through the sharing at the seminar, participants
        learnt about some of the latest technological advancement on medical
        testing and the benefits of R&Ds. We hoped that the testing and
        certification industry would be encouraged to make wider use of the ITF
        to invest in more R&D to advance their technical standard to a new
        level.
        <br />
        <br />
        Participants of the seminar had the opportunity to learn more about the
        R&D projects showcased at the seminar, to interact directly with the
        speakers and to explore the benefits and potentials of R&Ds.

        Information Security Management System Certification.
        <br />
        <br />
        Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a management system or
        a part of the overall management system using a systematic approach for
        establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing,
        maintaining and improving information security. It is applicable to
        organisations of all sizes and in all business sectors.
        <br />
        <br />
        Given the increasing concern over information security in society, more
        organisations are aware of the advantages of being certified to ISO/IEC
        27001, which is one of the most well-recognised ISMS standards globally.
        Certification of ISMS to ISO/IEC 27001 allows an organisation to
        demonstrate that its information assets are adequately protected against
        information security risks. It gives greater confidence to its business
        partners, authorities and other interested parties.
        <br />
        <br />
        The workshop gave an overview of ISO/IEC 27001 and discussed how to get
        prepared for the certification process. There was experience sharing by
        existing certified users, as well as an introduction on the services
        provided by the Hong Kong Accreditation Service.

        <br />
        <br />
        The Year 2015 is the International Year of Light. The metrology side of
        the seminar discussed the accurate measurement of light through
        photometry, radiometry and photonics. As for accreditation, the focus
        was on enhancing assurance of service quality in the health and social
        care industry through accreditation. The last but not least facet of the
        seminar spoke to participants on how standards act as a common language
        among people, machines, parts, products, and more.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar aimed to celebrate World Metrology Day, World Accreditation
        Day and World Standards Day by raising awareness of their importance in
        daily life, and how they collectively contribute to the global flow of
        goods and services, ideas and innovation.

        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Gold Testing and Gemstone Authentication in Hong Kong.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hong Kong is renowned for its jewellery trade and is one of the world
        top players in producing and exporting fashion jewellery, encompassing
        products from precious masterpiece to medium and low priced items. It is
        recognised worldwide for its production of pure gold products and
        jadeite jewellery, as well as the trading and distribution centre for
        pearls. The world's largest jewellery retailer in market capitalization
        is headquartered in Hong Kong and almost all luxury brands can be seen
        on the streets.
        <br />
        <br />
        Given the high value of jewellery, the industry has relied on Hong
        Kong's testing services for quality assurance and gemstone
        identification. The professional and quality services provided by local
        and international laboratories in Hong Kong have contributed to Hong
        Kong's competitiveness in both the Mainland and overseas jewellery
        markets.
        <br />

        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Healthy Life and Food Testing and Certification.
        <br />
        <br />
        Food safety and hygiene are critical to our health. Nowadays, consumers
        are paying more attention to food safety, diets, nutrition contents, and
        even product handling and management in the entire supply chain. People
        are generally conscious about healthy eating and the demand for quality
        food products is rising. Hong Kong's testing and certification industry,
        with its expertise in quality control, plays an important role in
        supporting the food trade in meeting various regulatory requirements as
        well as promoting consumers' confidence over the supply of foods.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the seminar, representative from Government's Centre for Food Safety
        introduced the regulations for formula products and pre-packaged foods
        for infants and young children. Testing and certification professionals
        shared their experiences in safeguarding food safety and hygiene,
        including food nutrition label tests, certification of organic food and
        sauce products, pesticide residues tests and so on. The seminar was also
        an opportunity for government representatives, practitioners of the
        testing and certification industry and food trade to share the needs and
        experiences of food testing and certification.

        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the

        <br />
        <br />
        Climate change is doubtlessly an enormous challenge faced by mankind of
        our time. To tackle climate change, many places around the world are
        implementing various initiatives to limit Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
        concentrations in the atmosphere. These initiatives rely on the
        quantification, monitoring, reporting, validation and verification of
        GHG emissions and/or removals.
        <br />
        <br />
        GHG validation and verification can enhance the credibility and
        transparency of your GHG quantification, monitoring and reporting.
        Indeed, GHG validation and verification has been attracting the
        attention of the community.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar was an opportunity for participants to have a better
        understanding of GHG validation and verification. Representatives from
        the Construction Industry Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation
        Service, as well as users of relevant services discussed the topic from
        different perspectives.

        新修正案國際單位制（SI）於2019年5月20日實施。作為測量基礎的SI於當天作出重大修訂。SI的七個基本單位以基本物理常數而被重新定義，消除了使用物理實物作為計量標準帶來的不穩定性，使SI
        基本單位有了“根本性飛躍”。
        <br />
        <br />
        國際單位制的修訂，使復現基本單位的準確度僅受限於物理自然和技術能力，而非其定義。近年開發或改進了許多創新的原級方法，根據物理定律去復現基本單位。另外在參考物質、以及化學和生物計量學領域上也取得了許多進展。研討會向本地測試和認證行業，以及對計量學感興趣的各方展示修訂後的國際單位制將如何提高測量科學和技術的準確度。另外，有關不同領域上原級標準的最新研究和發展也在研討會一併討論。

        <br />
        <br />
        新修正案國際單位制（SI）於2019年5月20日實施。作為測量基礎的SI於當天作出重大修訂。SI的七個基本單位當中，有四個以基本物理常數而被重新定義，打破現有使用實物標準的局限。是次修訂為新時代帶來關鍵的影響並促進未來發展。
        <br />
        <br />
        標準及校正實驗所（SCL）設計的海報獲選為2019年世界計量日的宣傳海報。設計概念圍繞現今世界採用的先進技術如人工智能（AI）、大數據、機械人技術、虛擬實境（VR）、5G和無人駕駛汽車等，均建基於講求精確測量的智能感應器及轉換器。通過更完善的計量基礎，可以建立一個更美好、更智慧的世界。這個研討會向香港的檢測和認證業，以及對計量學有興趣的人士，介紹SI的修訂如何使我們能夠進一步提升測量的科學與技術，以建立一個更美好、更智慧的世界。

        <br />
        <br />
        在現今競爭激烈的全球化經濟下，公司與機構須利用不同方法突圍而出，而認證是一種有力工具用以證明自身的能力。認證除確定公司與機構的系統和產品符合相關的國際標準之外，亦幫助它們展示其提供持續優質服務和產品的承諾，以滿足顧客的要求。認證提升和鞏固客戶的信心，並加強公信力。由於認證所帶來的好處，有些政府部門和機構更會把認證定為投標合約的規定。
        <br />
        <br />
        是次研討會旨在介紹認證的最新發展，包括國際標準化組織（ISO）最新推出的ISO
        45001職業健康安全管理體系認證，以及不同管理體系認證的最新版本如ISO
        50001:2018能源管理體系認證。研討會講者分享了他們使用認證服務的經驗和心得。

        第26屆國際度量衡大會（CGPM）於2018年11月重新定義現有國際單位制7個基本單位中的其中4個單位，分別為公斤、安培、開爾文和摩爾。新定義把相關基本單位與4個物理常數，分別是普朗克常數（h）、基本電荷值（e）、波茲曼常數（k）和阿伏伽德羅常數（NA）連結。新的定義獲得通過後，將於世界計量日，即2019年5月20日在全球實施。
        <br />
        <br />
        很明顯，這次重新定義國際單位事件將為全球的科學界及計量學界帶來重大影響。這個研討會的目的是向香港的檢測和認證業，以及對計量學有興趣的人士，介紹事件的最新發展。我們亦藉今次研討會，向與會者匯報另一份計量學界的重要文獻「測量不確定度表示指南」的修訂進展情況。

        香港檢測和認證局及香港認可處聯合舉辦了檢測認證對中小企的支援研討會。
        <br />
        <br />
        中小企業是香港經濟的支柱，佔全港企業的絶大多數，聘用私營機構總僱員人數的一半。若中小企能善用檢測認證服務提升國際競爭力，將會有利整體經濟。
        <br />
        <br />
        數十年來，香港的檢測和認證業一直協助製造業、出口及其他行業。該行業國際信譽昭著，香港發出的報告和證書被視為優秀的標記。檢測認證業為產品提供品質保證，幫助企業符合不同國際標準或法規，以減少回收產品、退貨及遭受投訴的機會，從而開創商機。測試以外，檢測和認證業亦提供多種管理系統認證服務，有助中小企提升管理及服務水平。
        <br />
        <br />
        是次研討會中，不同檢測認證機構及香港認可處介紹了檢測認證服務及其好處，以及分享怎樣選擇可靠的檢測認證服務。研討會亦介紹了支援中小企的配套，包括科技券計劃及可供共享的檢測設施，而我們亦邀請了中小企分享使用檢測認證服務的經驗，加深參加者對各演講題目的了解。

        <br />
        <br />
        資訊安全管理體系（Information Security Management
        System，簡稱ISMS）是一個管理系統，或整體管理系統的一部分，運用系統性的方法以建立、實施、運行、監控、審查、維護和改進訊息安全。ISMS適用於各行各業、不同規模的機構，尤其該等需要儲存及／或處理個人或商業敏感資訊。
        <br />
        <br />
        ISO/IEC
        27001是全球最廣為認識的ISMS標準之一。由於社會日益關注資訊保安問題及保安漏洞可招致之潛在損失，更多機構意識到取得ISO/IEC
        27001認證的好處。取得ISO/IEC 27001
        ISMS認證可讓機構展示其資訊資產受到充分保護，免受資訊保安風險影響，從而為業務夥伴、客戶、規管當局及其他相關人士帶來信心。
        <br />
        <br />
        是次工作坊提供ISO/IEC
        27001的概覽，並討論如何為認證過程作準備。工作坊亦包括獲認證用家的經驗分享，以及香港認可處的服務簡介。

        香港檢測和認證局及香港認可處聯合舉辦了醫務化驗認可 -
        提升品質與能力之路研討會。
        <br />
        <br />
        醫務化驗所在診斷方面，為醫學界提供了重要的支援，準確而可靠的化驗服務對作出適當臨床診斷與治療極為重要。認可服務為具有能力的醫務化驗所提供正式的第三方認可，獲認可的醫務化驗所的測試服務經過根據國際標準的嚴格評審，運作水平和測試結果的質素均有所保證。
        <br />
        <br />
        目前，認可在國際上被認定為質量和技術能力的信心指標。現今世界的趨勢都要求醫務化驗所獲取認可資格，有一些地方更將化驗所認可作為健康保險的付款及報銷費用的條件。大多國家的臨床測試研究也只接納由認可化驗所得出的數據。要與其他先進國家標準看齊，香港的醫務化驗所能夠透過認可對其測試技術能力和水平獲得正式肯定，實在非常重要。我們特別舉辦是次研討會，介紹醫務化驗認可服務，分享獲取認可的經驗及好處，並鼓勵醫務化驗所透過認可進一步提高專業水平。

        香港檢測和認證局及香港認可處聯合舉辦了建築材料產品認證研討會。
        <br />
        <br />
        為實現優質建築工程，引入建築材料檢測和認證服務是十分重要。產品認證正是透過第三方發出證書以證明經審核的產品符合特定的要求。
        <br />
        <br />
        產品認證的好處很多，例如上游監控可以提升產品品質，而持續監察工廠的生產程序可確保生產質素穩定，以及提高產品的可追溯性。
        <br />
        <br />
        透過第三方提供的品質監控，減低產品未能通過實地規格測試的機會，從而減少重新訂購產品而令工程延誤的風險，節省時間及金錢。另外，由於產品已符合特定要求或獲承認的標準，令使用者對產品質素更有信心。
        <br />
        <br />
        是次研討會旨在向建築業界介紹相關的產品認證，參加者趁此機會增加對建材產品認證的認識及了解產品認證如何在上游及生產過程中確保生產質素。

        <br />
        <br />
        資訊安全管理體系（Information Security Management
        System，簡稱ISMS）是一個管理體系或整體管理體系的一部分，基於一個系統性的方法用以建立、實施、運行、監控、審查、維護和改進資訊保安。ISMS適用於各行各業、不同規模的機構。
        <br />
        <br />
        ISO/IEC
        27001是全球最被廣爲認識的ISMS標准之一。由於社會日益關注資訊保安問題，更多機構意識到取得ISO/IEC
        27001認證的好處。獲得ISO/IEC 27001
        ISMS認證，可讓機構更能確保本身的資訊資產受到充分保護，免受資訊保安風險影響，從而爲業務夥伴、規管當局及其他相關人士帶來信心。
        <br />
        <br />
        是次工作坊提供ISO/IEC
        27001的概覽，並討論如何准備認證過程。工作坊亦邀得現有用家作經驗分享，以及介紹香港認可處提供的服務。

        <br />
        氣候變化無疑是人類當前面對的一項重大挑戰。爲了應對氣候變化，世界各地正在推行各項措施，控制大氣中溫室氣體的含量。推行這些措施，有賴對溫室氣體的排放及／或移除進行量化、監察、報告、審定和核查。
        <br />
        <br />
        進行溫室氣體審定和核查，可增加機構在溫室氣體量化、監察和報告方面的可信度和透明度。事實上，溫室氣體的審定和核查逐漸得到社會各界的關注。
        <br />
        <br />
        是次研討會旨在讓與會者了解溫室氣體審定和核查。建造業議會和香港認可處的代表，以及相關服務的用家，爲與會者就此題目作多角度的分享。
