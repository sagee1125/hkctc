        The Council, Government Laboratory, Hong Kong Metropolitan University
        and the Standards and Calibration Laboratory (SCL) of Innovation and
        Technology Commission have co-organised the Metrology Symposium 2022.
        <br />
        <br />
        Metrology is the science of measurement, embracing both experimental and
        theoretical determinations at any level of uncertainty in any field of
        science and technology. In our daily life, we will inevitably encounter
        applications related to metrology. For example, when running, we use a
        stopwatch to record timing; when sending mail, we use a pound and a
        ruler to measure the weight and size of the package respectively.
        Metrology also applies to chemical measurements, such as food inspection
        and environmental analysis, to protect our lives. Precise measurement
        can provide a solid foundation for the development of science and
        technology, thereby improving people's quality of life. In this seminar,
        we have shared some applications of metrology that are closely related
        to our everyday life, and have introduced the scientific principles
        behind them. The seminar has also introduced the latest developments in
        this year's World Metrology Day theme, " Metrology in the Digital Era".

    content: (
      <p>
        As our world gets increasingly digitalised and interconnected,
        information and cyber security continues to be a big concern.
        Organisations with inadequate security measures are often prone to
        unauthorised attacks and intrusion, thereby undermining the confidence
        of their clients and the public at large.
        <br />
        <br />
        Having a security management system is an effective way to control
        business risks. It helps to operate and monitor cyber and information
        security in a systematic manner. This webinar aims to introduce the
        latest trends of information and cyber security, and share the
        experience and insights in using information security management system
        certification in businesses and operations.

        The Council, Government Laboratory, the Open University of Hong Kong and
        the Standards and Calibration Laboratory (SCL) of Innovation and
        Technology Commission co-organised the Metrology Symposium 2021.
        <br />
        <br />
        Metrology is the science of measurement. It covers all theoretical and
        practical aspects of measurements, whatever the fields and applications.
        In the modern society, every aspect of our life will inevitably involve
        metrology. For example, our mobile phones are full of sensors to measure
        acceleration, rotational speed, light, sound and even altitude and
        magnetic field. Your smart watch can measure your heart rate and blood
        oxygen level besides telling you the time. You purchase food from the
        supermarket and numerous tests have been conducted on them by analysts
        behind the scene. Also, in time of pandemics, metrology has come to our
        defense. In this symposium, we have selected several interesting topics
        around our daily life to share how metrology plays its role. Taking this
        opportunity, the recent development in the transformation of the
        International System of Units (SI) to the digital world led by the
        International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) were also
        reported in this symposium.

      "“Underground Utility Survey Based on Nondestructive Testing, Surveying, Imaging and Diagnostic (NDTSID) Approaches” Webinar",
    date: "5 January 2021",
    content: (
      <p>
        The underground environment of Hong Kong consists of extensive arrays of
        utilities networks. All these networks serve our daily life through the
        provision of sewers, mains water, gas, telecommunications and
        electricity, etc. It is crucial to conduct regular and high-quality
        underground utility (UU) survey to ensure proper function of these
        utilities, thereby upholding efficient operation of the city.
        <br />
        <br />
        The webinar aims to introduce the latest development in conducting UU
        surveys using NDTSID approaches. Representatives from the Singapore Land
        Authority and Water Supplies Department of the Hong Kong SAR Government
        shared their experience and insights in different UU technologies and
        applications. Representatives from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University
        and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service also introduced the new
        specification standards for imaging and diagnosis of underground
        utilities using NDTSID approaches, and the new accreditation service for
        UU survey.

      <p>
        The Council, Government Laboratory, the Open University of Hong Kong and
        the Standards and Calibration Laboratory (SCL) of Innovation and
        Technology Commission co-organised the Metrology Symposium 2020.
        <br />
        <br />
        The International System of Units made a major revision of the SI, the
        foundation of measurements on May 20, 2019. The seven base units,
        namely, second, metre, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela were
        redefined based on the fundamental constants related to the fundamental
        laws of nature. The re-definition removes the instability imposed by the
        use of artefact standards and makes these SI base units “fundamentally
        better”.
        <br />
        <br />
        The revision of the SI enables the base units to be realized with
        accuracies limited only by the physical nature and our technical
        capability but not by their definitions. In recent year many innovative
        primary methods have been developed or refined for the practical
        realization of the base units using the law of physics. There were also
        numerous advances in the field of reference material and the metrology
        of chemistry and biology. The Symposium attempted to unfold to the local
        testing and certification industry as well as the parties interested in
        metrology how the revised SI will enable us to enhance the accuracy in
        measurement science and technology. Advance topics in the latest
        research and development related to the primary standards in various
        fields were also discussed.

      <p>
        The Council and Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised Seminar on
        Product Certification on Construction Materials.
        <br />
        <br />
        Building safety is of paramount importance, and quality of construction
        materials forms a vital part of it. Construction materials product
        certification helps assure quality of construction materials through
        third-party assessment. It enables upstream quality control from the
        start of the supply chain, facilitates better product traceability, and
        enhances production consistency. Through regular surveillance of the
        production process of construction materials, product certification
        reduces the risk of failure in on-site compliance testing. Users will
        also have greater confidence on product quality in view of its
        compliance with recognised standards or specific requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar aims to introduce how product certification could help
        improve construction and building quality. Representatives from the Hong
        Kong Concrete Institute, the Hong Kong Housing Authority and the Hong
        Kong Accreditation Service shared with us their experience and insights
        on the merits of adopting certified construction materials and products.
        An expert from BEAM Society also introduced the materials requirements
        under the recently launched BEAM Plus New Buildings V2.0, which have
        encompassed certified construction materials.

        The Council, Hong Kong Accreditation Service, the Standards and
        Calibration Laboratory and the Product Standards Information Bureau
        under the Innovation and Technology Commission as well as the Government
        Laboratory co-organised World Metrology Day (WMD), World Accreditation
        Day (WAD) and World Standards Day (WSD) Forum 2019.
        <br />
        <br />
        The International Network on Quality Infrastructure and the World Bank
        recently agreed on a new definition of the Quality Infrastructure (QI):
        ‘The system comprising the organisations (public and private) together
        with the policies, relevant legal and regulatory framework, and
        practices needed to support and enhance the quality, safety and
        environmental soundness of goods, services and processes.’ This system
        relies on metrology, standardisation, accreditation, conformity
        assessment and market surveillance. The QI is a crucial platform for
        promoting sustainable economic growth, as well as for maintaining
        environmental and social wellbeing. It does not only support domestic
        markets, but its international recognition is also essential for
        accessing foreign markets.
        <br />
        <br />
        This forum, organised in celebration of the World Metrology Day (WMD),
        World Accreditation Day (WAD) and World Standards Day (WSD), introduced
        the pivotal roles of metrology, accreditation and standards in
        supporting the QI.

      <p>
        The Council, Hong Kong Accreditation Service and Hong Kong Business
        Ethics Development Centre co-organised Seminar on Professional Ethics
        and Integrity in Testing and Certification.
        <br />
        <br />
        Integrity and credibility are foundation of good business. They also
        form part of the core value of Hong Kong’s testing and certification
        (T&C) sector and are an important aspect of our competitive edge. To
        sustain the sector’s good reputation, it is imperative for the T&C
        organisations to maintain a high standard of integrity and adopt good
        practices in their business and operations.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar invited representatives from the ICAC and the Customs and
        Excise Department to offer useful advice on anti-corruption regulations
        and fair trading practice, and analyse the common risks and ethical
        issues that may be encountered by T&C practitioners. A T&C organisation
        also shared its view on the importance of practising anti-bribery
        measures in the T&C trade.

    date: "18 March 2019",
    content: (
      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on New Opportunities for Testing and Certification in the Age of
        Technology.
        <br />
        <br />
        The rapid development of technology, together with Hong Kong's
        transformation into a smart city, is creating new opportunities for the
        testing and certification (T&C) sector. On the one hand, T&C bodies
        could adopt new technologies such as robotics, automation, artificial
        intelligence, data analytics, blockchain, etc. to enhance operation
        efficiency and improve customer service. On the other, the emergence of
        smart products and Internet of Things would generate new demands for
        third party quality and safety assurance.
        <br />
        <br />
        This seminar covered various topics including the latest developments of
        Hong Kong as a Smart City, new technologies which could be adopted by
        the T&C industry, and updates on measurement standards. The seminar also
        shared the potential needs for T&C services to cater for new types of
        smart products, and introduced some funding schemes that could support
        the adoption of technology. This seminar was an opportunity for testing
        and certification industry to obtain relevant information for grasping
        the new opportunities ahead.

    content: (
      <p>
        The Council, Hong Kong Accreditation Service and the Food Safety and
        Technology Research Centre of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University
        co-organised the Seminar on Testing and Certification for Food Safety.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nowadays, consumers are very vigilant about food safety and quality. To
        protect public health, the Government, food suppliers and catering
        establishments all play an important role in ensuring food sold in Hong
        Kong is safe and fit for consumption. The testing and certification
        (T&C) sector also serves as a gatekeeper, helping the food trade in
        ensuring their hygiene standards and meeting local regulations. It also
        helps the catering industry in enhancing consumers' confidence over food
        safety and hygiene through food certification..
        <br />
        <br />
        Local research institutes have also paid much efforts in safeguarding
        food safety through developing food technology. Through collaboration
        amongst the food trade, T&C industry and research institutes, the ever
        increasing public demand for safer, higher quality food products could
        be better met by applying these cutting-edge technologies.
        <br />
        <br />
        This seminar introduced to the audience latest development in food
        safety technology and regulation.

      <p>
        The Council, Government Laboratory, the Open University of Hong Kong and
        the Standards and Calibration Laboratory (SCL) of Innovation and
        Technology Commission co-organised the Metrology Symposium 2019.
        <br />
        <br />
        The International System of Units made a major revision of the SI, the
        foundation of measurements on May 20, 2019. Four of the seven SI base
        units namely kilogram, ampere, kelvin and mole were redefined based on
        the fundamental constants, which removed the current limitations imposed
        by the use of artefact standards. The change would bring significant
        impacts and further developments to the modern world.
        <br />
        <br />
        The poster designed by SCL was selected as the poster of the World
        Metrology Day 2019. The design ideas were based on modern world is
        becoming smarter with many smart technologies such as artificial
        intelligence (AI), big data, robotics, virtual reality (VR), 5G and
        autonomous vehicles etc., in which they are all built on smart sensors
        and transducers and rely on precision measurements. With better
        foundation of metrology, a better and smarter world can be built. This
        Symposium attempted to unfold to the local testing and certification
        industry as well as the parties interested in metrology how the revision
        of SI would enable us to embrace further improvements in measurement
        science and technology for a better and smarter world.

        The Council and Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the Seminar
        on Latest Development of Certification.
        <br />
        <br />
        In today's competitive global economy, companies and organisations have
        to explore different ways to stand out in the crowd. Certification is an
        effective tool to show one's competence. It helps companies and
        organisations demonstrate their commitment to delivering consistent
        quality service and products that meet customers' expectations, and
        assure compliance of their systems and products with international
        standards. It enhances and reinforces customers' confidence as well as
        adds credibility. In light of the benefits brought about by
        certification, some government departments and organisations even make
        certification a contractual requirement for tenders.
        <br />
        <br />
        This seminar aimed to introduce the latest development of certification
        including the newly developed ISO 45001 Occupational and Safety
        Management Systems Certification and updated versions of different
        management system certification released by International Organisation
        for Standardardization (ISO) such as ISO 50001:2018 Energy Management
        System Certification. Speakers shared their experience in making use of
        certification service to accomplish their objectives.

        <br />
        One of Hong Kong's key strengths is the high level of integrity and
        credibility of the Hong Kong society as a whole, which gives confidence
        to users of testing and certification (T&C) services. Maintaining a high
        level of professional integrity is of utmost importance and ensures that
        T&C services are provided in a reliable, consistent and impartial
        manner.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this workshop, representative of ICAC gave an analysis on common

        The Council, the Hong Kong Accreditation Service and Trade and Industry
        Department co-organised the Seminar on Latest Development of Testing and
        Certification under CEPA.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Mainland has again introduced new liberalisation measures relating
        to testing and certification (T&C) under the CEPA framework in recent
        months. Two liberalisation measures related to certification were
        introduced under the CEPA Agreement on Economic and Technical
        Cooperation signed in June 2017. The Implementation Guide for the
        Articles Relating to Certification and Accreditation in the CEPA
        Agreement on Trade in Services promulgated in September 2017 included
        new liberalisation measures in the areas of China Compulsory
        Certification (CCC) and factory inspection.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar was held to enhance knowledge of the local T&C industry on
        the Mainland market. Representatives from the Certification and
        Accreditation Administration of the People's Republic of China (CNCA)
        and China Quality Certification Centre (CQC) updated participants on the
        liberalisation measures, and discussed the cooperation arrangements
        between Hong Kong T&C industry and Mainland certification bodies.
        Representative from the Hong Kong Accreditation Service (HKAS) also
        briefed the audience on the procedures and requirements for local
        testing organisations to obtain accreditation for CCC testing.

        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on "Testing and Certification for Environmental Excellence".
        <br />
        <br />
        With increasing awareness of the importance of environmental protection,
        many enterprises and organisations have put in place green management
        and energy conservation measures. In this regard, the testing and
        certification industry has been providing valuable support. Local
        testing and certification bodies are helping to monitor the conditions
        of our environment. For example, they conduct testing on air samples to
        assess air quality, take water samples to check the amount of heavy
        metals, etc. In addition, they provide third party certification
        services for environmental related management systems to help
        enterprises and organisations achieve their environmental objectives in
        accordance with international standards.
        <br />
        <br />
        This seminar aimed to introduce how testing and certification services
        can help improve the environment and enhance energy efficiency for
        buildings, facilities and offices. We invited representatives from the
        Hong Kong Accreditation Service, professional body and testing and
        certification organisations to share their insights on the needs for and
        benefits of different environmental-related testing and certification
        services. A commercial company also shared its experience in making use
        of certification service to accomplish its environmental conservation
        objectives.

        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on "Support to the Testing and Certification Industry".
        <br />
        <br />
        Testing and certification is an industry where Hong Kong enjoys clear
        advantages. To support the industry for further development, different
        Government departments, public bodies and education institutions have
        been implementing various schemes and measures to enhance the
        competitiveness of the industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar aimed to introduce these schemes and measures to
        practitioners and stakeholders of the testing and certification
        industry. Representatives from Government departments spoke on the
        various funding schemes that provided support to the industry,
        especially small and medium enterprises. The Hong Kong Export Credit
        Insurance Corporation talked about its Testing and Inspection Services
        Policy. Two post-secondary institutions shared their experience in
        training and attracting talents, and introduced how the academia and the
        trade could work together for manpower development of the industry.

        The Council and the Standards and Calibration Laboratory co-organised
        the Metrology Symposium 2017.
        <br />
        <br />
        In November 2018, the 26th General Conference on Weights and Measures
        (CGPM) reviewed the International System of Units (SI) of four of the
        seven base units namely kilogram, ampere, kelvin and mole by fixing the
        values of the Planck constant (h), the elementary charge (e), the
        Boltzmann constant (k) and the Avogadro constant (NA). Upon approval,
        the redefined SI would be implemented worldwide on the following World
        Metrology Day which is on 20 May 2019.
        <br />
        <br />
        Obviously, this event will have major impacts on the worldwide science
        and metrology community. This Symposium attempted to unfold the latest
        development of this important event to the local testing and
        certification industry, as well as the parties interested in metrology.
        Taking this opportunity, the progress in revision of a seminal document
        for the metrology community – "Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in
        Measurement" was also reported in the Symposium.

        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Testing and Certification of Wireless and Telecommunication
        Products.
        <br />
        <br />
        In recent years, wireless, telecommunication and smart products have
        been undergoing rapid development and have formed an important part of
        people's daily life. While these products may help leading us to a
        smarter way of living, their safety and performance are of paramount
        concern.
        <br />
        <br />
        Testing and certification plays a vital role in ensuring the safety and
        quality of products. Through third party testing and certification
        services, manufacturers and traders could be assured that these products
        comply with international standards or regulations, thus enhancing
        product quality and consumer confidence, and establishing good
        reputation.
        <br />
        <br />
        This seminar aimed to introduce the latest trend and development in
        testing and certification on wireless and telecommunication products.
        Different parties including government department, trade and
        professional bodies, and testing and certification organisations were
        invited to share their insight on the needs, benefits and latest
        requirements for testing and certification of these products.

    title: "Support to SME from Testing and Certification",
    date: "19 January 2017",
    content: (
      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Support to SME from Testing and Certification.
        <br />
        <br />
        Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are an important pillar of Hong
        Kong's economy. They form the majority of enterprises in Hong Kong and
        employ half of the private-sector workforce. It would be beneficial to
        the whole economy if SMEs are able to enhance their global
        competitiveness through using testing and certification (T&C) services.
        <br />
        <br />
        For decades, the local T&C industry has been supporting the
        manufacturing, export and other sectors in Hong Kong. It enjoys good
        international reputation and testing reports and certificates issued in
        Hong Kong are hallmark of excellence. The T&C industry provides quality
        assurance and helps our SMEs to comply with different international
        standards and regulations, thus minimising the chance of recalls,
        returns and complaints, which all would ultimately translate to new
        business opportunities. Apart from testing, the industry also provides a
        wide range of management system certification service to help the SMEs
        to enhance their management and service quality.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this seminar, different T&C bodies and Hong Kong Accreditation
        Service introduced T&C services and their benefits, and shared how to
        select a reliable T&C service. Various support being provided to the
        SMEs such as the Technology Voucher Programme, and the testing
        facilities for shared use were introduced. We also invited SMEs to share
        their experience in using T&C service, deepening participants'
        understanding about the topics.

        products from all over the world can be found here. To maintain Hong
        Kong's reputation as the culinary capital of Asia, it is equally
        important to assure food safety as well as to maintain food variety and
        excellent culinary skill.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Government, the food and catering trade, and the testing and
        certification industry are the key players in ensuring food safety.
        Through regulatory control and other initiatives, the Government
        monitors food safety at critical points along the entire supply chain.
        The food and catering trade makes use of testing and certification
        services to enhance customers' confidence over safety and quality.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar aimed to provide participants with essential information on
        the food surveillance programme undertaken by the Centre for Food
        Safety, the professional support provided by the testing and
        certification industry as well as the experience of using testing and

      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Workshop on ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System
        Certification 2016.
        <br />
        <br />
        Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a management system or
        a part of the overall management system using a systematic approach for
        establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing,
        maintaining and improving information security. It is applicable to
        organisations of all sizes and in all business sectors, particularly
        those which need to store and/ or handle sensitive personal or
        commercial information.
        <br />
        <br />
        Given the increasing concern over information security and the potential
        loss to business due to security breaches, more organisations are aware
        of the advantages of being certified to ISO/IEC 27001, which is one of
        the most well-recognised ISMS standards globally. Certification of ISMS
        to ISO/IEC 27001 allows an organisation to demonstrate that its
        information assets are adequately protected against information security
        risks. It gives greater confidence to its business partners, clients,
        authorities and other interested parties.
        <br />
        <br />
        The workshop gave an overview of ISO/IEC 27001 and discussed how to get
        prepared for the certification process. There was also experience
        sharing by certified users, as well as an introduction on the services
        provided by the Hong Kong Accreditation Service.

    content: (
      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Testing and Certification for Fire Safety in Buildings.
        <br />
        <br />
        The recent fire at an industrial building in Hong Kong has sparked
        public concern about building fire safety. Fire safety in buildings is
        determined by a number of factors including, for example, the fire
        resistance of the building materials. It is vital that building
        structure and components as well as the fire products and equipment
        installed could meet stringent safety and performance standards. Testing
        and certification plays a key role in ensuring the performance and
        quality of these components, installations and equipment meet the latest
        fire safety requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this seminar, Government departments, professional bodies and
        institutions were invited to provide updates on the latest development
        of testing methods, requirements, properties and product certification
        schemes of different fire protection building components and products.

    date: "12 October 2016",
    content: (
      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Accreditation for Medical Laboratories – The Road Towards
        Quality and Competence.
        <br />
        <br />
        Medical laboratories provide essential support to the medical sector.
        Accurate and reliable laboratory services are crucial for proper
        clinical diagnosis and treatment. Accreditation provides formal
        third-party recognition to competent medical laboratories. The
        accredited medical laboratories are rigorously assessed against
        international standards in carrying out laboratory testing, thus
        assuring the standard of operation and quality of report.
        <br />
        <br />
        Today, accreditation is highly regarded internationally as an indicator
        of quality assurance and technical competence. There is a growing trend
        in the world to require accreditation for medical laboratories. In some
        places, accreditation becomes conditional for payments and reimbursement
        of expenses for health care insurance. The conduct of clinical trial
        studies in most countries also only accepts data from accredited
        laboratories. To be in line with the standards of other advanced
        countries, it is important for medical laboratories in Hong Kong to
        obtain formal recognition of their testing competence and standard
        through laboratory accreditation. The seminar was organised to introduce
        the medical testing accreditation, share the experience of obtaining
        accreditation and the benefits of it, and encourage medical laboratories
        to further enhance their professionalism through laboratory
        accreditation.

      <p>
        The Council, the Hong Kong Accreditation Service and the Independent
        Commission Against Corruption co-organised the Seminar on Integrity
        Management in Testing and Certification Industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the key strengths of the testing and certification industry in
        Hong Kong is its high level of credibility, which gives confidence to
        users and consumers. A single incident of malpractice, conflict of
        interest or corruption could ruin a hard-earned business, or even
        reputation and competitiveness of the whole industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar brought together experts from ICAC, the testing and
        certification industry as well as professional bodies to share
        experiences and information about integrity management in the testing
        and certification industry from different perspectives and how good
        practices could add values to enhance the credibility of a service
        provider. Participants took this opportunity to exchange views on
        integrity management with speakers.

        Given Hong Kong's proximity to Mainland and its long history as a major
        trading hub in the region, Hong Kong has played an important role in
        Chinese medicines trading. Traditional Chinese medicine has been
        increasing its popularity amongst local population. Many citizens would
        consult Chinese medicine practitioners and use Chinese medicines.
        <br />
        <br />
        To ensure that the Chinese medicines sold in Hong Kong are genuine, safe
        and with good quality, testing and certification is an important means.
        The seminar aimed to update participants the latest development of Hong
        Kong Chinese Materia Medica Standards and testing and certification
        services for Chinese medicines, and to share benefit to the trade
        through testing and certification.

    title: "Product Certification on Construction Materials",
    date: "13 November 2015",
    content: (
      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Product Certification on Construction Materials.
        <br />
        <br />
        Testing and certification services for construction materials are
        important as they contribute to quality construction projects. Product
        certification involves a third party issuing assurance that a product
        conforms to specific requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        The benefits of product certification are many. Product quality can be
        promoted through upstream control, and consistency of quality can be
        ensured through continuous surveillance of the production process in the
        factory, and there will be better traceability of products.
        <br />
        <br />
        Through these quality control actions provided by a third party, the
        risk of failure in on-site compliance testing is reduced, thereby
        reduces the risk of delay and the waste of time and money in case
        reordering is required. End-product users will have greater confidence
        on product quality in view of its compliance with recognised standards
        or specific requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar aimed to introduce to the construction sector about product
        certification. Participants took this opportunity to know more about
        product certification of construction materials/products and how it
        helps to ensure quality from the very beginning when the products are
        still being manufactured.

      <p>
        The Council, the Hong Kong Accreditation Service, the Hong Kong
        Association for Testing, Inspection and Certification and the
        Independent Commission Against Corruption co-organised the Seminar on
        Professional Integrity in Testing and Certification.
        <br />
        <br />
        It has been said that, in its bare bone, testing and certification
        service is but trustworthiness. While the saying oversimplifies matters,
        it carries a certain degree of truth: professional integrity is the
        cornerstone of the testing and certification industry. Commitment to
        professional integrity protects the industry from corruption, conflicts
        of interests and the like, as well as advances the industry's
        competitive advantage internationally. It is important for the
        industry's development to continue to maintain its high level of
        professional integrity.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar brought together experts from ICAC, the testing and
        certification industry, professional bodies as well as government
        departments to talk in details from different perspectives about the
        management and practice of professional integrity in the testing and
        certification industry. The seminar shared experience and information on
        training/recognition. Participants took this opportunity to exchange
        views on integrity management with the speakers.

      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Sharing on R&D Projects of Medical Testing.
        <br />
        <br />
        With growing awareness of the benefits of regular health check-ups and
        an aging population, the demand for medical testing has been on a steady
        rise in the past several years, and the trend is expected to maintain.
        For the testing and certification industry, the demand can be a
        challenge and an opportunity. One of the ways to meet the demand is
        through research and development (R&D) to develop new medical testing
        methods and techniques or improve existing ones. R&D advancements in
        medical testing will not only provide strong support to the testing and
        certification industry, but also benefit the general public.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar aimed to showcase several R&D projects on medical testing
        funded by the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF). ITF is a government
        initiative to encourage and assist organisations to upgrade their
        technological level. Through the sharing at the seminar, participants
        learnt about some of the latest technological advancement on medical
        testing and the benefits of R&Ds. We hoped that the testing and
        certification industry would be encouraged to make wider use of the ITF
        to invest in more R&D to advance their technical standard to a new
        level.
        <br />
        <br />
        Participants of the seminar had the opportunity to learn more about the
        R&D projects showcased at the seminar, to interact directly with the
        speakers and to explore the benefits and potentials of R&Ds.

      <p>
        The Council, the Hong Kong Accreditation Service and the Working Group
        on Cloud Security and Privacy under Office of Government Chief
        Information Officer co-organised the Workshop on ISO/IEC 27001
        Information Security Management System Certification.
        <br />
        <br />
        Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a management system or
        a part of the overall management system using a systematic approach for
        establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing,
        maintaining and improving information security. It is applicable to
        organisations of all sizes and in all business sectors.
        <br />
        <br />
        Given the increasing concern over information security in society, more
        organisations are aware of the advantages of being certified to ISO/IEC
        27001, which is one of the most well-recognised ISMS standards globally.
        Certification of ISMS to ISO/IEC 27001 allows an organisation to
        demonstrate that its information assets are adequately protected against
        information security risks. It gives greater confidence to its business
        partners, authorities and other interested parties.
        <br />
        <br />
        The workshop gave an overview of ISO/IEC 27001 and discussed how to get
        prepared for the certification process. There was experience sharing by
        existing certified users, as well as an introduction on the services
        provided by the Hong Kong Accreditation Service.

      <p>
        The Council, Hong Kong Accreditation Service, the Standards and
        Calibration Laboratory and the Product Standards Information Bureau
        under the Innovation and Technology Commission as well as the Government
        Laboratory co-organised the Seminar on the World Metrology Day (WMD),
        World Accreditation Day (WAD) and World Standards Day (WSD) 2015.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Year 2015 is the International Year of Light. The metrology side of
        the seminar discussed the accurate measurement of light through
        photometry, radiometry and photonics. As for accreditation, the focus
        was on enhancing assurance of service quality in the health and social
        care sector through accreditation. The last but not least facet of the
        seminar spoke to participants on how standards act as a common language
        among people, machines, parts, products, and more.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar aimed to celebrate World Metrology Day, World Accreditation
        Day and World Standards Day by raising awareness of their importance in
        daily life, and how they collectively contribute to the global flow of
        goods and services, ideas and innovation.

        <br />
        Hong Kong is renowned for its jewellery trade and is one of the world
        top players in producing and exporting fashion jewellery, encompassing
        products from precious masterpiece to medium and low priced items. It is
        recognised worldwide for its production of pure gold products and
        jadeite jewellery, as well as the trading and distribution centre for
        pearls. The world's largest jewellery retailer in market capitalization
        is headquartered in Hong Kong and almost all luxury brands can be seen
        on the streets.
        <br />
        <br />
        Given the high value of jewellery, the industry has relied on Hong
        Kong's testing services for quality assurance and gemstone
        identification. The professional and quality services provided by local
        and international laboratories in Hong Kong have contributed to Hong
        Kong's competitiveness in both the Mainland and overseas jewellery
        markets.

        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Healthy Life and Food Testing and Certification.
        <br />
        <br />
        Food safety and hygiene are critical to our health. Nowadays, consumers
        are paying more attention to food safety, diets, nutrition contents, and
        even product handling and management in the entire supply chain. People
        are generally conscious about healthy eating and the demand for quality
        food products is rising. Hong Kong's testing and certification industry,
        with its expertise in quality control, plays an important role in
        supporting the food trade in meeting various regulatory requirements as
        well as promoting consumers' confidence over the supply of foods.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the seminar, representative from Government's Centre for Food Safety
        introduced the regulations for formula products and pre-packaged foods
        for infants and young children. Testing and certification professionals
        shared their experiences in safeguarding food safety and hygiene,
        including food nutrition label tests, certification of organic food and
        sauce products, pesticide residues tests and so on. The seminar was also
        an opportunity for government representatives, practitioners of the
        testing and certification industry and food trade to share the needs and
        experiences of food testing and certification.

      <p>
        The Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation Service co-organised the
        Seminar on Greenhouse Gas Validation and Verification.
        <br />
        <br />
        Climate change is doubtlessly an enormous challenge faced by mankind of
        our time. To tackle climate change, many places around the world are
        implementing various initiatives to limit Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
        concentrations in the atmosphere. These initiatives rely on the
        quantification, monitoring, reporting, validation and verification of
        GHG emissions and/or removals.
        <br />
        <br />
        GHG validation and verification can enhance the credibility and
        transparency of your GHG quantification, monitoring and reporting.
        Indeed, GHG validation and verification has been attracting the
        attention of the community.
        <br />
        <br />
        The seminar was an opportunity for participants to have a better
        understanding of GHG validation and verification. Representatives from
        the Construction Industry Council and the Hong Kong Accreditation
        Service, as well as users of relevant services discussed the topic from
        different perspectives.
