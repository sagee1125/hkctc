      <p>
        Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) has been gaining lots of
        attention in the commercial world in the recent years. There is a
        growing trend whereby business entities attach great importance towards
        responsible and sustainable practices.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this seminar, speakers from the testing and certification (T&C)
        industry, academic and commercial sectors will share on how T&C services
        may facilitate business entities in addressing the ESG and
        sustainability challenges. The topics to be covered include managing ESG
        related data, responding to regulatory reporting requirements,
        evaluating ESG performance, etc.

        The rapid development of innovation and technology and the
        implementation of various initiatives of developing Hong Kong into a
        smart city have created opportunities for the testing and certification
        (T&C) sector, including enhancing the service quality and operation
        efficiency through digitilisation and automation in relation to
        construction testing.
        <br />
        <br />
        In this seminar, representatives from the Government departments and
        industry associations shared with us examples of digitilisation and
        automation in construction testing, the experience of implementing
        electronic test reports and digital certificates, as well as
        accreditation in digitalisation of test reports and automation of
        construction materials testing.

        <br />
        <br />
        Metrology is the science of measurement. It covers the theories and
        practices of measurements in different areas and applications. From the
        metering of water consumption, testing of construction materials,
        calibration of medical devices, to the measurement of time, coordinates,
        and sound, as well as chemical metrology, every aspect of our daily life
        will inevitably involve metrology. In this symposium, we have selected
        several interesting topics to illustrate how metrology plays its role.
        <br />
        <br />
        This year’s seminar included plenary lectures, sharing and discussion
        sessions covering various important topics, such as Chinese Medicine
        Hospital and clinical and applied research in Chinese medicines,
        gynaecology and research, as well as sharing session of young

        One of key strengths of the Hong Kong’s testing and certification (T&C)
        sector is the high level of integrity and credibility, which gives
        confidence to users of T&C services. To sustain the sector’s good
        reputation, it is imperative for the T&C organisations to maintain a
        high level of integrity and adopt good practices in their business and

        The Council, Government Laboratory, Hong Kong Metropolitan University
        and the Standards and Calibration Laboratory (SCL) of Innovation and
        Technology Commission have co-organised the Metrology Symposium 2022.
        <br />
        <br />
        Metrology is the science of measurement, embracing both experimental and
        theoretical determinations at any level of uncertainty in any field of
        science and technology. In our daily life, we will inevitably encounter
        applications related to metrology. For example, when running, we use a
        stopwatch to record timing; when sending mail, we use a pound and a
        ruler to measure the weight and size of the package respectively.
        Metrology also applies to chemical measurements, such as food inspection
        and environmental analysis, to protect our lives. Precise measurement
        can provide a solid foundation for the development of science and
        technology, thereby improving people's quality of life. In this seminar,
        we have shared some applications of metrology that are closely related
        to our everyday life, and have introduced the scientific principles
        behind them. The seminar has also introduced the latest developments in
        this year's World Metrology Day theme, " Metrology in the Digital Era".
